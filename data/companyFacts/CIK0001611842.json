Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid Investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, generally consist of marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and may include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, or held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year), as applicable.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":66596000,"accn":"0001213900-21-013722","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2021-03-05","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":52906000,"accn":"0001213900-21-045608","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"6-K/A","filed":"2021-08-30","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":32203000,"accn":"0001213900-22-009722","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-02-28","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":23779000,"accn":"0001213900-22-046331","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"6-K","filed":"2022-08-10","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-12-31","val":12594000,"accn":"0001213900-23-025399","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2023-03-31","frame":"CY2022Q4I"}]}},"CashCashEquivalentsRestrictedCashAndRestrictedCashEquivalents":{"label":"Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents","description":"Amount of cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalents restricted to withdrawal or usage.
