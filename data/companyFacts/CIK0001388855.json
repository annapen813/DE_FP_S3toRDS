That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2012-01-01","end":"2012-06-30","val":0.8,"accn":"0001185185-12-001666","fy":2012,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2012-08-09"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2012-01-01","end":"2012-06-30","val":0.0225,"accn":"0001185185-12-001666","fy":2012,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2012-08-09"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingNumber":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Number","description":"Number of options outstanding, including both vested and non-vested options.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2012-06-30","val":50000,"accn":"0001185185-12-001666","fy":2012,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2012-08-09","frame":"CY2012Q2I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
