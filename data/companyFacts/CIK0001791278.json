Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.5923,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0161,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementsByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisesInPeriodWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangements by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Exercises in Period, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average price at which option holders acquired shares when converting their stock options into shares.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.01,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"CNY/shares":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":5.96,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021Q4I"}]}},"StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesStockOptionsExercised":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Exercises in Period","description":"Number of share options (or share units) exercised during the current period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":907779,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueStockOptionsExercised":{"label":"Stock Issued During Period, Value, Stock Options Exercised","description":"Value of stock issued as a result of the exercise of stock options.","units":{"CNY":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":64034,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"UnrecognizedTaxBenefits":{"label":"Unrecognized Tax Benefits","description":"Amount of unrecognized tax benefits.","units":{"CNY":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001104659-22-051505","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2022-04-28","frame":"CY2021Q4I"}]}}}}}
