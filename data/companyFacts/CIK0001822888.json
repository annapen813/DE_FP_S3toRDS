Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"end":"2021-01-26","val":0.147,"accn":"0001213900-21-030794","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-03"},{"end":"2021-01-26","val":0.147,"accn":"0001213900-21-043490","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"},{"end":"2021-01-26","val":0.147,"accn":"0001213900-21-060114","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":0.128,"accn":"0001213900-21-030794","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-03","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":0.218,"accn":"0001213900-21-043490","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.1583,"accn":"0001213900-21-060114","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"end":"2021-01-26","val":0.0071,"accn":"0001213900-21-030794","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-03"},{"end":"2021-01-26","val":0.0071,"accn":"0001213900-21-043490","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"},{"end":"2021-01-26","val":0.0071,"accn":"0001213900-21-060114","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0124,"accn":"0001213900-21-030794","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-03","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0105,"accn":"0001213900-21-043490","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0112,"accn":"0001213900-21-060114","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-01-26","val":9.59,"accn":"0001213900-21-030794","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-03"},{"end":"2021-01-26","val":9.59,"accn":"0001213900-21-043490","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"},{"end":"2021-01-26","val":9.59,"accn":"0001213900-21-060114","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.67,"accn":"0001213900-21-030794","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-03","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.92,"accn":"0001213900-21-043490","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":9.91,"accn":"0001213900-21-060114","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
