Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Expected Volatility Rate","description":"The estimated measure of the percentage by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-11-01","end":"2020-11-03","val":0.11,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28"},{"start":"2020-11-01","end":"2020-11-03","val":0.11,"accn":"0001213900-22-005048","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2022-02-02","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-039082","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-07-28"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-22-005048","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2022-02-02"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.344,"accn":"0001213900-22-018778","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-08","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.152,"accn":"0001213900-21-039612","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-07-30","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.18,"accn":"0001213900-21-048028","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-09-14"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.109,"accn":"0001213900-21-060017","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-16"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.123,"accn":"0001213900-22-018778","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-08"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.123,"accn":"0001213900-22-025274","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-10"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.123,"accn":"0001213900-22-045876","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.123,"accn":"0001213900-22-073717","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-18","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":0.037,"accn":"0001213900-22-025274","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-10","frame":"CY2022Q1"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-06-30","val":0.028,"accn":"0001213900-22-045876","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based
