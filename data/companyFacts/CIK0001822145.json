US treasury securities are negotiable debt obligations of the US government, secured by its full faith and credit and issued at various schedules and maturities. The income from treasury securities is exempt from state and local, but not federal, taxes. There are three types of securities issued by the US treasury (bonds, bills, and notes), which are distinguished by the amount of time from the initial sale of the bond to maturity.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":174266206,"accn":"0001213900-22-026430","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-13","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":176009525,"accn":"0001213900-22-026430","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-13","frame":"CY2022Q1"}]}},"LongTermNotesPayable":{"label":"Notes Payable, Noncurrent","description":"Carrying value as of the balance sheet date of notes payable (with maturities initially due after one year or beyond the operating cycle if longer), excluding current portion.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2022-03-31","val":200000,"accn":"0001213900-22-026430","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-13","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":1725000,"accn":"0001213900-22-047958","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-15","frame":"CY2022Q2I"}]}},"PartnersCapitalAccountOptionExercise":{"label":"Partners' Capital Account, Option Exercise","description":"Total change in each class of partners' capital accounts during the year due to option exercise.
