Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2022-03-31","val":11500000,"accn":"0001493152-22-013056","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-12","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":11500000,"accn":"0001493152-22-021548","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-08","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-09-30","val":11500000,"accn":"0001493152-22-032329","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-15","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"CostsAndExpensesRelatedParty":{"label":"Costs and Expenses, Related Party","description":"Costs of sales and operating expenses for the period incurred from transactions with related parties.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-04-15","end":"2021-06-30","val":445,"accn":"0001493152-22-021548","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-08","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-04-15","end":"2021-09-30","val":445,"accn":"0001493152-22-032329","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-15"}]}},"AssetsHeldInTrustCurrent":{"label":"Assets Held-in-trust, Current","description":"The amount of cash, securities, or other assets held by a third-party trustee pursuant to the terms of an agreement which assets are available to be used by beneficiaries to that agreement only within the specific terms thereof and which agreement is expected to terminate within one year of the balance sheet date (or operating cycle, if longer) at which time the assets held-in-trust will be released or forfeited.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2022-09-30","val":117378204,"accn":"0001493152-22-032329","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-15","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"DeferredCompensationLiabilityCurrent":{"label":"Deferred Compensation Liability, Current","description":"Aggregate carrying value as of the balance sheet date of the liabilities for all deferred compensation arrangements payable within one year (or the operating cycle, if longer).
