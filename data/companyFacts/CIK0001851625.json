That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-11-01","end":"2021-11-05","val":0.163,"accn":"0001213900-22-019905","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-11-01","end":"2021-11-05","val":0.0045,"accn":"0001213900-22-019905","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardPerShareWeightedAveragePriceOfSharesPurchased":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Per Share Weighted Average Price of Shares Purchased","description":"Per share weighted-average price paid for shares purchased on open market for issuance under share-based payment arrangement.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-11-05","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-22-019905","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"SharesSubjectToMandatoryRedemptionSettlementTermsNumberOfShares":{"label":"Financial Instruments Subject to Mandatory Redemption, Settlement Terms, Number of Shares","description":"The number of shares that would be issued, determined under the conditions specified in the contract, if the settlement were to occur at the reporting date.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":20125000,"accn":"0001213900-22-019905","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-15","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":20125000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027159","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":20125000,"accn":"0001213900-22-045406","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-08","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-09-30","val":20125000,"accn":"0001213900-22-069377","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-04","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueConversionOfUnits":{"label":"Stock Issued During Period, Value, Conversion of Units","description":"Value of stock issued during the period upon the conversion of units.
