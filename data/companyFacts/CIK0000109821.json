While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a credit balance consistent with its label.","units":{"JPY":[{"start":"2008-04-01","end":"2009-03-31","val":-1512000000,"accn":"0001193125-11-178060","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2011-06-30","frame":"CY2008"},{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2010-03-31","val":556000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2010-03-31","val":556000000,"accn":"0001193125-11-178060","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2011-06-30"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2011-03-31","val":804000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29","frame":"CY2010"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2011-03-31","val":804000000,"accn":"0001193125-11-178060","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2011-06-30"},{"start":"2011-04-01","end":"2012-03-31","val":538000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29","frame":"CY2011"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeDerivativesQualifyingAsHedgesNetOfTaxPortionAttributableToNoncontrollingInterest":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Derivatives Qualifying as Hedges, Net of Tax, Portion Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest","description":"Amount after tax and reclassification adjustments, of increase (decrease) in accumulated gain (loss) from derivative instruments designated and qualifying as the effective portion of cash flow hedges and an entity's share of an equity investee's increase (decrease) in deferred hedging gain (loss), attributable to noncontrolling interests.","units":{"JPY":[{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2010-03-31","val":-14000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2011-03-31","val":-1000000,"accn":"0001193125-13-273651","fy":2012,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2013-06-27","frame":"CY2010"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2011-03-31","val":-1000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29"},{"start":"2011-04-01","end":"2012-03-31","val":7000000,"accn":"0001193125-13-273651","fy":2012,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2013-06-27","frame":"CY2011"},{"start":"2011-04-01","end":"2012-03-31","val":7000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29"},{"start":"2012-04-01","end":"2013-03-31","val":9000000,"accn":"0001193125-13-273651","fy":2012,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2013-06-27","frame":"CY2012"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeDerivativesQualifyingAsHedgesNetOfTaxPortionAttributableToParent":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Derivatives Qualifying as Hedges, Net of Tax, Portion Attributable to Parent","description":"Amount after tax and reclassification adjustments, of increase (decrease) in accumulated gain (loss) from derivative instruments designated and qualifying as the effective portion of cash flow hedges and an entity's share of an equity investee's increase (decrease) in deferred hedging gain (loss), attributable to parent entity.","units":{"JPY":[{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2010-03-31","val":570000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2011-03-31","val":805000000,"accn":"0001193125-13-273651","fy":2012,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2013-06-27","frame":"CY2010"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2011-03-31","val":805000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29"},{"start":"2011-04-01","end":"2012-03-31","val":531000000,"accn":"0001193125-13-273651","fy":2012,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2013-06-27","frame":"CY2011"},{"start":"2011-04-01","end":"2012-03-31","val":531000000,"accn":"0001193125-12-288532","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-06-29"},{"start":"2012-04-01","end":"2013-03-31","val":186000000,"accn":"0001193125-13-273651","fy":2012,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2013-06-27","frame":"CY2012"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeDerivativesQualifyingAsHedgesTaxEffectPeriodIncreaseDecrease":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Derivatives Qualifying as Hedges, Tax Effect (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"Total tax effect of the change in accumulated gains and losses from derivative instruments designated and qualifying as the effective portion of cash flow hedges.
