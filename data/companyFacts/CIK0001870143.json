Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.089,"accn":"0001213900-22-066197","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-10-25","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2021-06-09","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.089,"accn":"0001213900-22-006998","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-11"},{"start":"2021-06-09","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.089,"accn":"0001213900-22-043401","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-01"},{"start":"2021-06-09","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.089,"accn":"0001213900-23-018280","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-07"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":0.089,"accn":"0001213900-22-021239","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-04-25","frame":"CY2022Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0137,"accn":"0001213900-22-066197","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-10-25","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2021-06-09","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0137,"accn":"0001213900-22-006998","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-11"},{"start":"2021-06-09","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0137,"accn":"0001213900-22-043401","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-01"},{"start":"2021-06-09","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0137,"accn":"0001213900-23-018280","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-07"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":0.0137,"accn":"0001213900-22-021239","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-04-25","frame":"CY2022Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardPerShareWeightedAveragePriceOfSharesPurchased":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Per Share Weighted Average Price of Shares Purchased","description":"Per share weighted-average price paid for shares purchased on open market for issuance under share-based payment arrangement.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-06-08","val":0.0001,"accn":"0001213900-22-006998","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-11","frame":"CY2021Q2I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":12,"accn":"0001213900-22-006998","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-11","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":12,"accn":"0001213900-22-021239","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-04-25","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-04-01","val":11.5,"accn":"0001213900-23-018280","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-07"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":12,"accn":"0001213900-22-043401","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-01","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-09-30","val":12,"accn":"0001213900-22-066197","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-10-25","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-06-01","end":"2021-06-17","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-22-006998","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-11","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"start":"2021-11-01","end":"2021-11-10","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-22-021239","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-04-25"},{"start":"2021-11-01","end":"2021-11-10","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-22-043401","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-01"},{"start":"2021-11-01","end":"2021-11-10","val":10000,"accn":"0001213900-22-066197","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-10-25","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
