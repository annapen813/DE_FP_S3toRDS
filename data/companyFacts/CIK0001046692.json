Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2011-12-31","val":359826,"accn":"0001193125-12-181991","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-04-25","frame":"CY2011Q4I"}]}},"UnrealizedGainLossOnDerivatives":{"label":"Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives","description":"The net change in the difference between the fair value and the carrying value, or in the comparative fair values, of derivative instruments, including options, swaps, futures, and forward contracts, held at each balance sheet date, that was included in earnings for the period.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-12-31","val":-503000,"accn":"0001193125-12-181991","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-04-25","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-12-31","val":-476000,"accn":"0001193125-12-181991","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-04-25","frame":"CY2010"},{"start":"2011-01-01","end":"2011-12-31","val":68000,"accn":"0001193125-12-181991","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F","filed":"2012-04-25","frame":"CY2011"}]}}}}}
