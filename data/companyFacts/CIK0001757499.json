Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.855,"accn":"0001493152-22-032276","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.855,"accn":"0001493152-23-007686","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-15","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-12-31","val":0.8487,"accn":"0001493152-23-007686","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-15","frame":"CY2022"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0073,"accn":"0001493152-22-032276","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0073,"accn":"0001493152-23-007686","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-15","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-12-31","val":0.0245,"accn":"0001493152-23-007686","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-15","frame":"CY2022"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExercisableWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Exercisable, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"The weighted-average price as of the balance sheet date at which grantees can acquire the shares reserved for issuance on vested portions of options outstanding and currently exercisable under the stock option plan.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2022-09-30","val":4,"accn":"0001493152-22-032276","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2022-09-30","val":13.88,"accn":"0001493152-22-032276","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"},{"end":"2022-12-31","val":13.88,"accn":"0001493152-23-007686","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-15","frame":"CY2022Q4I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
