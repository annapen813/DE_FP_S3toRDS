A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction that is attributable to a particular risk. The change includes an entity's share of an equity investee's increase or decrease in deferred hedging gains or losses. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a credit balance consistent with its label.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":56000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"},{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":-155000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2009Q2"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeForeignCurrencyTransactionAndTranslationAdjustmentNetOfTaxPeriodIncreaseDecrease":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Adjustment, Net of Tax (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"Adjustment that results from the process of translating subsidiary financial statements and foreign equity investments into the reporting currency of the reporting entity, net of tax.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":-3474000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"},{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":26011000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2009Q2"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-06-30","val":-23038000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2010-06-30","val":-30110000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2010Q2"}]}},"OtherLiabilitiesNoncurrent":{"label":"Other Liabilities, Noncurrent","description":"Amount of liabilities classified as other, due after one year or the normal operating cycle, if longer.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2009-12-31","val":30195000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2009Q4I"},{"end":"2010-06-30","val":65741000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2010Q2I"}]}},"OtherNonoperatingIncomeExpense":{"label":"Other Nonoperating Income (Expense)","description":"Amount of income (expense) related to nonoperating activities, classified as other.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":566000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"},{"start":"2009-04-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":-646000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2009Q2"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-06-30","val":-1936000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"},{"start":"2010-04-01","end":"2010-06-30","val":-1412000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03","frame":"CY2010Q2"}]}},"PaymentsForRepurchaseOfCommonStock":{"label":"Payments for Repurchase of Common Stock","description":"The cash outflow to reacquire common stock during the period.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":25706000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-06-30","val":106587000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"}]}},"PaymentsToAcquireInvestments":{"label":"Payments to Acquire Investments","description":"The cash outflow associated with the purchase of all investments (debt, security, other) during the period.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-06-30","val":107210000,"accn":"0000950123-10-071784","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-03"}]}},"PaymentsToAcquirePropertyPlantAndEquipment":{"label":"Payments to Acquire Property, Plant, and Equipment","description":"The cash outflow associated with the acquisition of long-lived, physical assets that are used in the normal conduct of business to produce goods and services and not intended for resale;
