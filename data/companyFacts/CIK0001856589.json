However, a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":303005300,"accn":"0001213900-22-020108","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-04-15"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":303005300,"accn":"0001213900-22-027135","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":303005300,"accn":"0001213900-22-047443","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-12"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":303005300,"accn":"0001213900-22-072372","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":303035812,"accn":"0001213900-22-027135","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":303097650,"accn":"0001213900-22-047443","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-12","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-09-30","val":304471491,"accn":"0001213900-22-072372","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"ContractWithCustomerLiability":{"label":"Contract with Customer, Liability","description":"Amount of obligation to transfer good or service to customer for which consideration has been received or is receivable.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001213900-22-027135","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001213900-22-047443","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-12"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001213900-22-072372","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":380040,"accn":"0001213900-22-027135","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":38381,"accn":"0001213900-22-047443","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-12","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-09-30","val":1363584,"accn":"0001213900-22-072372","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"DeferredTaxAssetsOther":{"label":"Deferred Tax Assets, Other","description":"Amount, before allocation of valuation allowance, of deferred tax asset attributable to deductible temporary differences, classified as other.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":195000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027135","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":111605,"accn":"0001213900-22-027135","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1I"}]}},"DerivativeLiabilities":{"label":"Derivative Liability","description":"Fair value, after the effects of master netting arrangements, of a financial liability or contract with one or more underlyings, notional amount or payment provision or both, and the contract can be net settled by means outside the contract or delivery of an asset.
