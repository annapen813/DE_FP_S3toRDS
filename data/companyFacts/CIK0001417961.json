While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a credit balance consistent with its label.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2011-01-01","end":"2011-12-31","val":72000,"accn":"0001193125-12-241197","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2012-05-21","frame":"CY2011"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeForeignCurrencyTransactionAndTranslationAdjustmentNetOfTaxPeriodIncreaseDecrease":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Adjustment, Net of Tax (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"Adjustment that results from the process of translating subsidiary financial statements and foreign equity investments into the reporting currency of the reporting entity, net of tax.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2008-01-01","end":"2008-12-31","val":-2578000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09","frame":"CY2008"},{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-12-31","val":-48000,"accn":"0001193125-12-241197","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2012-05-21","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-12-31","val":48000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-12-31","val":3722000,"accn":"0001193125-12-241197","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2012-05-21","frame":"CY2010"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-12-31","val":-3722000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09"},{"start":"2011-01-01","end":"2011-12-31","val":8615000,"accn":"0001193125-12-241197","fy":2011,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2012-05-21","frame":"CY2011"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeForeignCurrencyTransactionAndTranslationGainLossArisingDuringPeriodNetOfTax":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Gain (Loss) Arising During Period, Net of Tax","description":"Amount after tax, before reclassification adjustments of gain (loss) on foreign currency translation adjustments, foreign currency transactions designated and effective as economic hedges of a net investment in a foreign entity and intra-entity foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term-investment nature.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-12-31","val":145000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-12-31","val":-506000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09","frame":"CY2010"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeForeignCurrencyTransactionAndTranslationReclassificationAdjustmentRealizedUponSaleOrLiquidationNetOfTax":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Reclassification Adjustment Realized upon Sale or Liquidation, Net of Tax (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"Reclassification adjustment for translation gains or losses realized upon the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in foreign entity, after tax.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2009-01-01","end":"2009-12-31","val":36000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09","frame":"CY2009"},{"start":"2010-01-01","end":"2010-12-31","val":-202000,"accn":"0000950123-11-057820","fy":2010,"fp":"FY","form":"20-F/A","filed":"2011-06-09","frame":"CY2010"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossNetOfTaxPeriodIncreaseDecrease":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"This element represents Other Comprehensive Income or Loss, Net of Tax, for the period.
