Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.482,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-08-15","val":0.35,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-12-31","val":0.65,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2022"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.014,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-08-15","val":0.029,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-12-31","val":0.04,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2022"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNonOptionEquityInstrumentsExercised":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Non-Option Equity Instruments, Exercised","description":"Number of non-option equity instruments exercised by participants.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":1083008,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsForfeituresAndExpirationsInPeriod":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Forfeitures and Expirations in Period","description":"For presentations that combine terminations, the number of shares under options that were cancelled during the reporting period as a result of occurrence of a terminating event specified in contractual agreements pertaining to the stock option plan or that expired.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":1717,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriod":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Net of Forfeitures","description":"Net number of share options (or share units) granted during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":214642,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementsByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsExpirationsInPeriodWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangements by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Expirations in Period, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average price at which grantees could have acquired the underlying shares with respect to stock options of the plan that expired.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":30,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2022-08-15","val":10.18,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2022Q3I"},{"end":"2022-11-30","val":2.09,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23"},{"end":"2022-12-31","val":1.78,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2022Q4I"}]}},"ShortTermLeaseCost":{"label":"Short-term Lease, Cost","description":"Amount of short-term lease cost, excluding expense for lease with term of one month or less.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":601000,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-12-31","val":419000,"accn":"0001829126-23-002201","fy":2022,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2023-03-23","frame":"CY2022"}]}},"StockIssuedDuringPeriodValueIssuedForServices":{"label":"Stock Issued During Period, Value, Issued for Services","description":"Value of stock issued in lieu of cash for services contributed to the entity.
