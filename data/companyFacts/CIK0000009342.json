comprehensive income resulting from the settlement or curtailment of the entity's defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. A settlement is defined as a transaction that (a) is an irrevocable action, (b) relieves the employer or plan of a primary responsibility for a pension benefit obligation, and (c) eliminates significant risks related to the obligations and the assets used to effect the settlement. A curtailment is an event that significantly reduces the expected years of future service of present employees or eliminates for a significant number of employees the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2010-01-03","end":"2010-07-03","val":-6013000,"accn":"0001193125-10-185746","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-11"},{"start":"2010-01-03","end":"2010-10-02","val":-6013000,"accn":"0001193125-10-255522","fy":2010,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-11-10"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeFinalizationOfPensionAndNonPensionPostretirementPlanValuationTax":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Defined Benefit Plan, Adjustment for Settlement or Curtailment Gain (Loss), Tax","description":"Amount of tax expense (benefit) for increase (decrease) to other comprehensive income from settlement and curtailment gain (loss) of defined benefit plan.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2010-01-03","end":"2010-07-03","val":3715000,"accn":"0001193125-10-185746","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-11"},{"start":"2010-01-03","end":"2010-10-02","val":3715000,"accn":"0001193125-10-255522","fy":2010,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-11-10"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeForeignCurrencyTransactionAndTranslationAdjustmentNetOfTaxPeriodIncreaseDecrease":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation Adjustment, Net of Tax (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"Adjustment that results from the process of translating subsidiary financial statements and foreign equity investments into the reporting currency of the reporting entity, net of tax.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2010-01-03","end":"2010-07-03","val":-1781000,"accn":"0001193125-10-185746","fy":2010,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-08-11"},{"start":"2010-01-03","end":"2010-10-02","val":3877000,"accn":"0001193125-10-255522","fy":2010,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2010-11-10"}]}},"OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossNetOfTaxPeriodIncreaseDecrease":{"label":"Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax (Deprecated 2012-01-31)","description":"This element represents Other Comprehensive Income or Loss, Net of Tax, for the period.
