Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0875,"accn":"0001213900-22-050233","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-23"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0875,"accn":"0001213900-22-074253","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-21","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2021-02-08","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0875,"accn":"0001213900-22-016858","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-03-31"},{"start":"2021-02-08","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0875,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":0.0225,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-06-30","val":0.03,"accn":"0001213900-22-050233","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-23"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-09-30","val":0.02,"accn":"0001213900-22-074253","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-21"}]}},"StockIssuedDuringPeriodSharesRestrictedStockAwardForfeited":{"label":"Stock Issued During Period, Shares, Restricted Stock Award, Forfeited","description":"Number of shares related to Restricted Stock Award forfeited during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-10-01","end":"2021-10-31","val":200000,"accn":"0001213900-22-016858","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-03-31"},{"start":"2021-10-01","end":"2021-10-31","val":200000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16"},{"start":"2021-10-01","end":"2021-10-31","val":200000,"accn":"0001213900-22-050233","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-23"},{"start":"2021-10-01","end":"2021-10-31","val":200000,"accn":"0001213900-22-074253","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-21","frame":"CY2021Q3I"}]}},"ValuationAllowanceDeferredTaxAssetChangeInAmount":{"label":"Valuation Allowance, Deferred Tax Asset, Increase (Decrease), Amount","description":"Amount of increase (decrease) in the valuation allowance for a specified deferred tax asset.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-02-08","end":"2021-12-31","val":114567,"accn":"0001213900-22-016858","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-03-31","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ExcessStockSharesIssued":{"label":"Excess Stock, Shares Issued","description":"Number of excess stock shares of an entity that have been sold or granted to shareholders.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":2850000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":2850000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1I"}]}},"ExcessStockSharesOutstanding":{"label":"Excess Stock, Shares Outstanding","description":"Number of shares of excess stock held by shareholders.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":2850000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":2850000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2022Q1I"}]}},"ProceedsFromNotesPayable":{"label":"Proceeds from Notes Payable","description":"The cash inflow from a borrowing supported by a written promise to pay an obligation.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-02-08","end":"2021-03-31","val":150000,"accn":"0001213900-22-027194","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-16","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-02-08","end":"2021-06-30","val":150000,"accn":"0001213900-22-050233","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-23"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-06-30","val":800000,"accn":"0001213900-22-050233","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-23"}]}},"StockholdersEquityIncludingPortionAttributableToNoncontrollingInterest":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity, Including Portion Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest","description":"Amount of stockholders' equity (deficit), net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity, attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling interests.
