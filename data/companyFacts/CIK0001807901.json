Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-06-30","val":0.715,"accn":"0001564590-20-042014","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-31"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-09-30","val":0.715,"accn":"0001564590-20-054183","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-16"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.827,"accn":"0001564590-20-042014","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-31"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0.827,"accn":"0001564590-20-054183","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-16"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-09-30","val":0.0191,"accn":"0001564590-20-054183","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-16"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0.0017,"accn":"0001564590-20-054183","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-16"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMaximum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Maximum","description":"The maximum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-06-30","val":0.026,"accn":"0001564590-20-042014","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-31"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.0017,"accn":"0001564590-20-042014","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-31"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMinimum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Minimum","description":"The minimum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-06-30","val":0.0196,"accn":"0001564590-20-042014","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-31"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-06-30","val":0.0014,"accn":"0001564590-20-042014","fy":2020,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-08-31"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Number of Shares Available for Grant","description":"The difference between the maximum number of shares (or other type of equity) authorized for issuance under the plan (including the effects of amendments and adjustments), and the sum of: 1) the number of shares (or other type of equity) already issued upon exercise of options or other equity-based awards under the plan;
