Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.1,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.1,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.05,"accn":"0001213900-22-008268","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-17","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":0.05,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2022Q1"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-06-30","val":0.018,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0114,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.01,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0131,"accn":"0001213900-22-008268","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-17","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-03-31","val":0.0242,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2022Q1"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-06-30","val":0.0301,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-31","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.87,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":9.76,"accn":"0001213900-22-008268","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-17","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":9.79,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":9.83,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09","frame":"CY2022Q2I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-12-31","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-22-008268","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-02-17","frame":"CY2021Q4I"},{"end":"2022-03-31","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-22-027572","fy":2022,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-05-17","frame":"CY2022Q1I"},{"end":"2022-06-30","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-22-045967","fy":2022,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-08-09","frame":"CY2022Q2I"},{"end":"2022-09-30","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-22-071381","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"TemporaryEquityRedemptionPricePerShare":{"label":"Temporary Equity, Redemption Price Per Share","description":"Amount to be paid per share that is classified as temporary equity by entity upon redemption.
