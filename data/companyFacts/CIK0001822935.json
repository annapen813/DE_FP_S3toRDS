Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.15,"accn":"0001213900-21-030073","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-01"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.15,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.15,"accn":"0001213900-21-043208","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.15,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.123,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.097,"accn":"0001213900-22-016918","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-03-31","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0116,"accn":"0001213900-21-030073","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-01"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0116,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0096,"accn":"0001213900-21-043208","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"},{"start":"2021-04-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":0.0096,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q2"},{"start":"2021-07-01","end":"2021-09-30","val":0.0102,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.0127,"accn":"0001213900-22-016918","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-03-31","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsForfeituresInPeriod":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Forfeitures in Period","description":"The number of shares under options that were cancelled during the reporting period as a result of occurrence of a terminating event specified in contractual agreements pertaining to the stock option plan.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":281250,"accn":"0001213900-21-030073","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-01","frame":"CY2021Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":281250,"accn":"0001213900-21-043208","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.66,"accn":"0001213900-21-030073","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-01"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":9.66,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q1I"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.65,"accn":"0001213900-21-043208","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"},{"end":"2021-06-30","val":9.65,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q2I"},{"end":"2021-09-30","val":9.86,"accn":"0001213900-21-059300","fy":2021,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-11-15","frame":"CY2021Q3I"},{"end":"2021-12-31","val":9.82,"accn":"0001213900-22-016918","fy":2021,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2022-03-31","frame":"CY2021Q4I"}]}},"SponsorFees":{"label":"Sponsor Fees","description":"Fees paid to advisors who provide certain management support and administrative oversight services including the organization and sale of stock, investment funds, limited partnerships and mutual funds.","units":{"USD":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-06-30","val":225000000,"accn":"0001213900-21-043208","fy":2021,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-08-17"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
