Short-term investments, exclusive of cash equivalents, generally consist of marketable securities intended to be sold within one year (or the normal operating cycle if longer) and may include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, or held-to-maturity securities (if maturing within one year), as applicable.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2010-12-31","val":18735,"accn":"0001096906-11-002727","fy":2011,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-11-14","frame":"CY2010Q4I"},{"end":"2010-12-31","val":18735,"accn":"0001096906-11-001662","fy":2011,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-08-08"},{"end":"2011-06-30","val":32059,"accn":"0001096906-11-001662","fy":2011,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-08-08","frame":"CY2011Q2I"},{"end":"2011-09-30","val":32023,"accn":"0001096906-11-002727","fy":2011,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-11-14","frame":"CY2011Q3I"}]}},"CommonStockParOrStatedValuePerShare":{"label":"Common Stock, Par or Stated Value Per Share","description":"Face amount or stated value per share of common stock.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2010-12-31","val":0.001,"accn":"0001096906-11-002727","fy":2011,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-11-14","frame":"CY2010Q4I"},{"end":"2010-12-31","val":0.001,"accn":"0001096906-11-001662","fy":2011,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-08-08"},{"end":"2011-06-30","val":0.001,"accn":"0001096906-11-001662","fy":2011,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-08-08","frame":"CY2011Q2I"},{"end":"2011-09-30","val":0.001,"accn":"0001096906-11-002727","fy":2011,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-11-14","frame":"CY2011Q3I"}]}},"CommonStockSharesAuthorized":{"label":"Common Stock, Shares Authorized","description":"The maximum number of common shares permitted to be issued by an entity's charter and bylaws.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2010-12-31","val":300000000,"accn":"0001096906-11-002727","fy":2011,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-11-14","frame":"CY2010Q4I"},{"end":"2010-12-31","val":300000000,"accn":"0001096906-11-001662","fy":2011,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-08-08"},{"end":"2011-06-30","val":300000000,"accn":"0001096906-11-001662","fy":2011,"fp":"Q2","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-08-08","frame":"CY2011Q2I"},{"end":"2011-09-30","val":300000000,"accn":"0001096906-11-002727","fy":2011,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2011-11-14","frame":"CY2011Q3I"}]}},"CommonStockSharesIssued":{"label":"Common Stock, Shares, Issued","description":"Total number of common shares of an entity that have been sold or granted to shareholders (includes common shares that were issued, repurchased and remain in the treasury).
